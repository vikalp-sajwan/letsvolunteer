                        <li><p><b>You get to help those who need it.</b> This is the obvious benefit, right? But it’s also the most important part. As a volunteer, you have a great opportunity to give back in any area that is important to you. What passion could you pass on to others?</p></li>

<li><p><b>Volunteering is great for your mental and even physical health.</b> Not only does volunteering boost self-confidence and happiness, but it has also been found that people who volunteer have lower mortality rates than those who don’t.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Volunteering can teach you the social and networking skills that you will need as an adult.</b> Volunteering can teach youngsters how to network and build a list of important contacts. The people you volunteer with are also great candidates for recommendation letters. These are the people who have seen how you interact with others in social situations and how you handle new challenges.</p></li>

                        <li><p><b>Volunteering lets you see how others experience the world and opens your eyes to something new.</b> From volunteering with animals to giving food at animal shelters, volunteering can expose you to very new experiences that you may not have known otherwise. Having new experiences can help you discover a new passion, and gives you the contacts to pursue that passion.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Make your resume shine.</b> Volunteer experience can set you apart from other applicants for job and school applications. Your volunteer experience shows that you are ambitious, that you care about your community, and that you are willing to work to affect change. These are great qualities that recruiters and admissions officers look for in a potential student or employee.</p></li></ol>
