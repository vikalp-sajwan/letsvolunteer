##Project Name: letsVolunteer.com
###Volunteer experience can set you apart from other applicants for job and school applications. Your volunteer experience shows that you are ambitious, that you care about your community, and that you are willing to work to affect change.
###letsVolunteer.com is a dynamic website whose motive is to connect charitable organizations and NGOs with the willing volunteers. It will also have features to manage and keep a central record for all the volunteering activities, which can be used as verifiable links for volunteering activities which a person can add to his/her CV.

####The project will be developed using core web technologies:
•	HTML - for making webpages.
•	CSS - for styling and look of the website.
•	PHP - for backend of the website.
•	MySQL - for the database of the website.
•	JavaScript - for any kind of interactivity if needed.
####Features:
•	The user will be able to sign up and create account.
•	Any user can create Events with all the details of event.
•	Other interested users can volunteer in such events.
•	All the data about events organised, details of users who volunteered, and also the details that which of the volunteers actually attended the event will be stored in in the database.
•	Another module of website will keep all the records of the past events such as pictures articles and photographs.


####Modules:
•	Homepage with basic info about websites and recently organized event stories.
•	User Account Side Bar to manage user accounts login signup etc.
•	Events page to list upcoming events.
•	Event News page to display the news about past events.
•	User Account page to view all the volunteering data about the logged in user.

####Advantages:
•	This type of website will help to bridge the gap between the organization and NGOs and willing volunteers.
•	And a verifiable volunteering activities will encourage more people to volunteer, do the good work as well as make their resume shine.
####Disadvantages: 
•	This type of website cannot be fully automatic. It needs manual administration to verify the accounts of NGOs and organizations.
•	Further, it also needs some type of mechanism (human + s/w) to verify the volunteering activities of users i.e. whether they actually showed up in the event. I have some solutions in mind but for now this website will not have any kind of such mechanism.
